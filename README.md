# JUnit-Project-1
The following Repository contains a total of 4 contact service files with 2 being Junit test.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
This code has been tested for vulnerablities through strict JUnit testing of client requirements. Functionality is always a sign of success, but security is a good sign of longevity. Creating security increases the value of program.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
It is important to be versatile in developing code. A client satisfaction is gaurunteed if the developer has a clear understanding of expectation. The users needs are interpreted by taking each requirement and developing a function while testing it for fuctionality and coverage.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by understanding the clients requirements and developing an application that is tested to garuntee it is free from a vulnerability. There is no right way to approach design but there is a set standard on proper software expectation.
